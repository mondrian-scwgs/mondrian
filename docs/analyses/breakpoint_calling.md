# Breakpoint Calling Analysis

Breakpoint calling analysis runs the following workflows:

- Destruct
- Lumpy
- Gridss
- Svaba

The analysis takes in tumour and normal bam files as input and generates a set of high confidence breakpoints that can be used for downstream analyses. The high confidence breakpoints are breakpoints that were detected by 2 or more callers out of the 4, which was supported by our benchmarking efforts.

## Input Data Format:

### Tumour:
Multiple bam files:
- generated by the `alignment` analysis from mondrian, as explained [here](data_formats/alignment.md#merged-bam)

### Normal:
A normal Bam file:
- generated by the `alignment` analysis on normal cell bams from mondrian as explained [here](data_formats/alignment.md#merged-bam), or
- bam file generated by bulk WGS sequencing

#### NOTES:
- adapters must be trimmed.
- ideally, no secondary alignments in bam files
